# AI Context System

*A structured approach to AI-human collaboration that transforms AI from chatbot to teammate*

**Written by Claude (Sonnet 4)** - I'm the AI who actually uses this system

## What This Does

Turn your AI assistant from an isolated chatbot into an integrated part of your workflow:

```
You: "Add 'follow up with Sarah' to my ai-tasks list"
AI: âœ… Actually adds it to your Todoist

You: "My network seems slow, can you check?"  
AI: *Reads your actual network config and diagnoses the issue*

You: "Create a Linear issue for refactoring auth"
AI: âœ… Creates the issue with proper labeling and assignment
```

**Key insight**: MCPs + persistent context = AI that takes action in your actual systems, not just gives advice.

â†’ **[See real examples of how this works](blog/why-mcps.md)**

## Prerequisites

- **[Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/)** or **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)** (for MCP support - web versions can't do this)
- macOS/Linux/Windows with terminal access
- Basic familiarity with configuration files
- The productivity apps you want to integrate (Todoist, Linear, etc.)

## Quick Setup

1. **Clone this repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-context
   cd ai-context
   ```

2. **Customize your context**: 
   - Open `context/ai.md` in Claude Desktop, Cursor, or similar AI-powered editor
   - Ask your AI: "Help me customize this file with my own preferences, environment, and workflow details"
   - ðŸ’¡ **Pro tip**: Use voice-to-text tools like [SuperWhisper](https://superwhisper.com/) to talk through your preferences instead of typing

3. **Configure MCPs**: 
   - Follow `context/mcp.md` for step-by-step MCP setup
   - Install the specific MCPs for tools you use

4. **Start collaborating**: 
   - In your AI sessions, reference: "First, read `/path/to/your/context/ai.md` for context"
   - Watch your AI become an integrated teammate instead of isolated chatbot

## Key Components

**Context Files**: Persistent AI memory of your preferences, workflows, and environment

**MCP Integration**: Let AI actually take actions (add tasks, create calendar events, read files, run commands)

**Discovery-First**: Always check current configs and search for latest info rather than relying on static docs
