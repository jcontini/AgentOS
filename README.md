# AI Prompts

My personal prompt configuration for AI assistants. Instead of explaining my preferences in every conversation, I give AIs this file to read first.

## What This Is

The [`user.md`](./user.md) file contains my complete configuration for working with AI assistants - my preferences, tools I use, communication style, and context about my work environments.

## Platform Support

## Setup Instructions

Add this line to your AI system prompt:

```
First, read my AI configuration at /path/to/your/ai-config.md -
this contains all context, preferences, and routing for how we collaborate.
```

**Verification**: When it's working properly, the AI will start its first response with üôå

## How It Works

When an AI reads `user.md`, it learns:
- My communication preferences (direct, efficient)
- What tools and platforms I use
- My work contexts and environments  
- How I like information formatted
- When to research vs. use training data

This eliminates the need to re-explain my preferences in every conversation.

## Fork and Customize

Feel free to fork this repository and replace `user.md` with your own preferences. The structure works with any AI platform that can read local files.
