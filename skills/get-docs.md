# Get Documentation Skill

## Intention: Understand how an SDK, library, or API works

1. **First**: Try using Context7 MCP to find & read the latest docs for the library/API
2. **If Context7 doesn't work**: Use web search (see `skills/web-search.md`) to find the library/API documentation

## When to use

- If you run into even 1 issue using a library/API
- When you need to understand how a library works
- When looking up API endpoints or SDK methods

## Context7 MCP

- [Context7 MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/context7) - API & library documentation lookup
