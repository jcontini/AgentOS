# AI Collaboration BIOS

*Universal framework for AI-Human collaboration that works across any platform*

## What is this?

A universal framework that transforms any AI from isolated chatbot into persistent, cross-platform teammate.

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **🤝 No systematic AI collaboration**<br/>Everyone's just winging it with whatever their platform offers | **🧠 Universal BIOS Framework**<br/>Structured collaboration system that works across any AI platform |
| **🔒 Platform lock-in**<br/>Cursor memory ≠ Claude memory ≠ ChatGPT memory | **🌐 Interface-Agnostic Design**<br/>Markdown-based context and routing that works identically everywhere |
| **🔄 Memory dies between sessions**<br/>Every conversation starts from zero | **🔗 Session Continuity**<br/>`temp.md` handoff protocol seamlessly continues work across platforms |
| **🚫 Built-in tools don't work**<br/>"Web search" pretends to read URLs, file tools are interface-specific | **🛠️ Real Tool Integration**<br/>MCP ecosystem for actual URL reading, file access, and system actions |
| **📚 Static documentation goes stale**<br/>Reality changes faster than docs | **⚡ System-as-Source-of-Truth**<br/>Live verification of actual system state, evolving documentation |

## Quick Start

1. **Fork this repository** to create your AI collaboration workspace
2. **Customize `personal.md`** with your preferences and tools  
3. **Start any AI session** with this context loaded
4. **Experience persistent, capable AI** that remembers across platforms

## How It Works

The framework transforms AI interaction through structured context files:

- **`bios.md`** - Universal routing table and collaboration principles
- **`personal.md`** - Your specific preferences and environment  
- **`temp.md`** - Session handoff bridge (auto-managed)
- **`tech.md`**, **`mcp.md`** - Domain-specific context as needed

Each AI session loads this context and becomes capable of:
- Continuing previous work seamlessly
- Taking real actions in your systems  
- Maintaining memory across platform switches
- Working with current system state rather than outdated assumptions

## Why This Matters

We're moving toward AI as integrated teammate, not isolated chatbot. This framework:

- **Scales with AI capabilities** - works with current models and future ones
- **Prevents platform lock-in** - your AI collaboration investment is portable
- **Enables real productivity** - persistent context + actual tool access
- **Community-driven evolution** - improves through real-world usage
